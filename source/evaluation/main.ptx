    <p>
      This course will use <alert>Standards Based Grading</alert>.
      The content is broken into <em>standards</em> that you are expected to master by the end of the course.
    </p>

    <p>
      This grading system is <em>iterative</em> in the sense that you will have multiple opportunities to display mastery of each standard, and <em>forgetful</em> in the sense that your previous unsuccessful attempts are discarded once you demonstrate mastery of a standard.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mastering a standard is a two-step process.
      You will need to earn a score of <alert>M</alert> on the Homework that goes with the standard <em>and</em> an in-class Assessment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A description of each standard can be found in the <xref ref="standards" text="title"/> section.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="assessments">
    <title>Assessments</title>
    <p>
      This course will have in-class, written assessments.
      You may not use the text, your notes, or any devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each assessment will contain problems corresponding to one or more standards.
      The standards are scored <em>independently</em> using the scale in the <xref ref="scoring" text="title"/> section.
      To master a standard, you must earn a score of <alert>M</alert> on <alert>all</alert> of the problems that go with the standard.
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <title>Reassessment</title>
      <p>
	There are scheduled Reassessment days for this course (see the <xref ref="schedule" text="title"/>) where you will be given problems for <em>every</em> standard that you have <em>not yet mastered</em>.
	You may attempt as many standards as time allows.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="homework">
    <title>Homework</title>
    <p>
      Homework will be assigned regularly.
      The problems are chosen to highlight the core concepts from the standards.
      Mastery of these homework sets serves as a good indicator for performance on assessments.
      As such, you should enure that you fully understand the material on these homework sets; that is, upon completion of the homework set, you should be capable of completing similar problems without the aid of the text, a computer, or any other tools not available during an exam.
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <title>Reassessment</title>
      <p>
	You may resubmit <alert>one</alert> homework set that you have not mastered each week.
	You only need to correct and resubmit the exercises with mistakes.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

  <subsection xml:id="scoring">
    <title>Scoring</title>
    <p>
      All written work in this course will be scored on the following scale.
